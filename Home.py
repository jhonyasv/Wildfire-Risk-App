    ## Abstract  
    Wildfires pose a significant threat to ecosystems, human life, and infrastructure. This thesis develops a wildfire risk prediction system leveraging deep learning methods and remote sensing data. The objectives include:
    - **Exploring** how Earth Observation data cubes can enhance spatiotemporal analysis,
    - **Assessing** the suitability of various deep learning algorithms (RF, LSTM, CNN, ConvLSTM) for wildfire risk prediction,
    - **Integrating** static and dynamic variables to improve real-time risk assessments.
    
    **Key Findings:**
    - LSTM achieved an AUROC of 89% with an F1-score of 72%, balancing temporal dependencies and classification trade-offs.
    - CNN exhibited the highest sensitivity (84%) but with lower precision.
    - RF reached the highest AUROC (91%) yet faced challenges with sensitivity.
    - Feature importance analysis highlighted human modification, land surface temperature, and temperature as critical predictors.
    
    This work contributes to advancing scalable, data-driven models for wildfire prediction and offers valuable insights for enhancing fire management strategies in South America.
